## Scenario-Based Recommendations

### Personal Use - Occasional Parsing
**Recommended: Docker**

Why: Easy setup, isolated, no ongoing maintenance

Example: Parse Google Takeout once a year
```bash
docker run -v ./mail_data:/data mailparser/app parse --mbox /data/takeout.mbox
```

---

### Personal Use - Frequent Parsing
**Recommended: Native Installation**

Why: Best performance, most convenient for daily use

Example: Regular email archiving and analysis
```bash
mail-parser parse --mbox ~/Downloads/emails.mbox --output ~/mail_archive
```

---

### Small Team (2-5 people)
**Recommended: Cloud (Railway or Render)**

Why: Share access, no individual setup needed

Example: Team analyzing customer support emails
- Deploy once
- Share URL with team
- Everyone can access dashboards

---

### Developer/Tester
**Recommended: Docker**

Why: Reproducible environment, easy to test changes

Example: Testing mail parser modifications
```bash
docker build -t mailparser-dev .
docker run -v ./tests:/data mailparser-dev parse --mbox /data/test.mbox
```

---

### Privacy-Conscious User
**Recommended: Native Installation**

Why: Complete control, no data leaves your machine

Example: Parsing confidential emails
- Install locally
- Never connect to internet
- All processing offline

---

### Large Organization
**Recommended: Cloud (self-hosted) or Docker Swarm**

Why: Centralized management, scalable, secure

Example: Company-wide email archiving
- Deploy to private cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Internal network only
- Automated backups

---

## Migration Paths

### From Native to Docker
```bash
# Export your data
cp -r ~/mail_parser/output ./docker_output

# Run in Docker
docker run -v ./docker_output:/output mailparser/app
```

### From Docker to Cloud
```bash
# Build and push image
docker build -t your-registry/mailparser .
docker push your-registry/mailparser

# Deploy to cloud with image
```

### From Cloud to Native
```bash
# Download your output
curl https://your-app.railway.app/output.zip -o output.zip

# Install natively
./install_macos.sh  # or install_windows.ps1, install_linux.sh
```

## Cost Analysis (Annual)

### Personal Use (Process 10K emails/month)

| Option | Year 1 | Year 2+ | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Native** | $0 | $0 | Free forever |
| **Docker** | $0 | $0 | Free (Docker Desktop) |
| **Cloud (Free)** | $0 | $0 | Within free limits |
| **Cloud (Paid)** | $84-$300 | $84-$300 | Better resources |

### Team Use (5 users, 50K emails/month)

| Option | Year 1 | Year 2+ | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Native** | $0 × 5 = $0 | $0 | Each user installs |
| **Docker** | $0 × 5 = $0 | $0 | Each user runs locally |
| **Cloud (Shared)** | $168-$300 | $168-$300 | One deployment for all |

**Winner for teams: Cloud** - Same cost, much easier management

## Security Considerations

### Native Installation
- **Data location**: Your computer
- **Network exposure**: None (unless you share)
- **Access control**: Your OS login
- **Risk level**: Low (you control everything)

### Docker
- **Data location**: Docker volumes (your computer)
- **Network exposure**: Only what you expose
- **Access control**: Your OS login + Docker isolation
- **Risk level**: Low (isolated from host)

### Cloud
- **Data location**: Cloud provider servers
- **Network exposure**: Internet (use HTTPS)
- **Access control**: Platform authentication
- **Risk level**: Medium (depends on provider)

**Recommendations:**
- Sensitive data: Use Native or Docker locally
- Shared access needed: Use Cloud with strong passwords
- Public access: Never (always require authentication)

### Development Environment
**Best: Docker**
- Consistent across team
- Easy to test changes
- Quick to rebuild

### Testing Environment
**Best: Docker**
- Reproducible tests
- Isolated from other tests
